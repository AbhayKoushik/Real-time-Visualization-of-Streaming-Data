# Real-time-Visualization-of-Streaming-Data

Simplistic python code to visualize by graphing scattered matplotlib plots, the streaming data (EEG from the wearable sensors in this case) from a server-client web socket in real-time.

1. Real-time-Data-Visualization.py: Program for scattered plotting with incoming data with time stamps from the receiver program.
2. Data-vs-Time-plotting.py: Program for line plotting with incoming data along with time stamps from the sender socket.
